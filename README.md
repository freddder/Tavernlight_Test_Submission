# Reproduction

### Question 5

- To repro, make you you have a druid character that knows the spell Megidolaon. You can do this by adding an entry to the player_spells with ```INSERT INTO `player_spells`(`player_id`, `name`) VALUES ([PLAYER_ID],"megidolaon")```

# .spr and .dat file

The .spr file was too big to upload to the Github repository, so I zipped both of them. Before running the program make sure to unzip `Tibia.zip` on `Client\data\things\1098`.
